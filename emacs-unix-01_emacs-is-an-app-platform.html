  <h3>Emacs does not have <q>extensions,</q> it has apps</h3>

  <p>There is one argument that I have got very tired of hearing,
  which goes something like this:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>If the UNIX Philosophy is that <q>every prorogram does one
    thing, and does it well,</q> then Emacs is the opposite of
    that. It is a text editing program that tries to
    do <b>everything</b>. It has extensions for being an e-mail
    client and web client, for playing music, for managing Git
    branches, even for playing Tetris. Who needs a text editor with
    that much bloat? Emacs may as well be an operating system, not an
    editor.</i></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There are two problems with this argument:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>Emacs is not a text editor, it is an interactive Lisp
    runtime environment, i.e. it is a programming language. Emacs
    really does do just one thing, and does it well: it runs Lisp
    programs.</p></li>

    <li><p>Most of those <q>extensions,</q> except maybe Tetris, are
    not bloat, they are Lisp <b>packages</b>, or <q>apps</q> if you
    will, that run in the Emacs runtime. (Well, some people actually
    kind of <em>need</em> Tetris.) Most other programming languages
    you install will come with a selection of useful packages along
    with it &mdash; maybe even Tetris if perhaps it is designed
    for <a href="https://love2d.org/">programming games</a>. And like
    Python&apos;s PIP, Perl&apos;s CPAN, Ruby&apos;s Gem, Node&apos;s
    NPM, Rust&apos;s Cargo, Haskell&apos;s Cabal, and Common
    Lisp&apos;s QuickLisp, Emacs does have it's
    own <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Packages.html">package
    manager</a> and package repository as well, called
    <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org">ELPA</a>.</p>

  </ol>

  <h4>The Emacs text editor is also an app</h4>

  <p>The text editor in Emacs is just another one of the pre-installed
  Lisp packages. The text editor happens to be the first thing you see
  when you run Emacs with a file as an argument, so it is
  understandable that people confuse Emacs with an ordinary text
  editor.</p></li>

  <p>So I think it is better to define Emacs not as an editor, but as
  a Lisp app platform. It can be thought of as analogous to how the
  World Wide Web is a JavaScript app platform, or Microsoft&apos;s
  .NET is a C# app platform. Emacs is not an OS, but it is easy to see
  why an app platform might be confused for an OS &mdash; OSs and app
  platforms do share a lot in common. On small platforms like
  smartphones and tablets, the OS and app platform are
  indistinguishable, even on Android OS which uses the Linux
  kernel.</p>

  <h4>Emacs Lisp is a powerful programming language</h4>

  <p>I also think Emacs Lisp is a pretty powerful language in it's own
  right, as most languages in the Lisp family are. Lisp programs
  running in Emacs can be much more composable than other programs
  in <a href="https://archive.org/details/unixprogramminge0000kern">the
  UNIX Programming Environment</a>. One reason for this is that Lisp
  is a proper functional programming (FP) language, while the Bourne
  shell family of languages are not, as I
  will <a href="./emacs-unix-03_unix-is-lesser-fp.html">try to explain
  in part 3 of this series</a>. Emacs also provides APIs for running
  POSIX processes, so Emacs can act as a shell just as well or better
  than Bash can.</p>

  <p>Although Emacs is most effective if used as an interactive Lisp
  programming environment, some people I know of do use Emacs
  as <em>just</em> a text editor, and often it is because they are
  most familiar with the key bindings. People in this camp could care
  less about Lisp or any of the other Emacs apps. For people who use
  Emacs in this way, I would recommend using a lighter-weight text
  editor
  like <a href="https://www.jedsoft.org/jed/">Jed</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jonmacs/jove">Jove</a>,
  <a href="https://homepage.boetes.org/software/mg/">MG</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/zile/">Zile</a>,
  or <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/e3editor/">e3em</a>. Honestly
  though, I don&apos;t think the key bindings are Emacs&apos;s
  greatest strength. In my opinion, there is little purpose in using
  an Emacs-like editor unless you really just love the key bindings.
  The true strength of GNU Emacs is it&apos;s app ecosystem.</p>

  <h3>Conclusions</h3>

  <p>This was a very short article that I hope dispenses with the
  biggest misconception of Emacs, at least in my experiences talking
  about it with peers. I hope we can agree from the beginning that we
  should define Emacs <em>not</em> as a text editor, but as an app
  platform for which apps are programmed in a dialect of the Lisp
  programming language. But I have only breifly discussed here how
  this relates to the UNIX philosophy, so this is what I will talk
  about at length next
  time, <a href="./emacs-unix-02_what-is-the-unix-philosophy.html">in
  part 2 of this series</a>.</p>
