  <p>In the <a href="./emacs-unix-03_unix-is-lesser-fp.html">part 3 of
  this series</a> I talked about how the UNIX Philosophy, the idea
  that <q>every program does one thing, and does it well</q> have
  several defining principles in common with functional programming
  (FP). In particular, functions in FP should also <q>do one thing and
  do it well</q>, so <q>programs</q>  and <q>functions</q> are
  conceptually the same. But to do FP, you must be able to compose
  functions together using higher-order functions.</p>

  <p>I will take for granted the fact that Lisp is commonly
  acknowledge to be a FP language, so I will not explain why Lisp is a
  FP language. This article is more about how UNIX shell programming,
  the Bourne family of programming languages, are <em>not</em> FP
  languages, and there are only a few built-in language constructs for
  composing programs, like the pipe operator
  (<q><code>|</code></q>). This proves to be quite the limitation when
  it comes to composing programs. When composing programs or functions
  together to solve larger problems, a Lisp programming language has
  an advantage over a Bourne-style programming language. Refer to
  the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html">Eshell</a>
  programming language, which combines a Bourne shell-like language
  with Emacs Lisp, as just on example of how Lisp can improve on the
  UNIX Programming Environment.</p>

  <p>My goal here is not to evangelize Emacs. I readily admit Emacs is
  far from perfect, and that there are certainly better
  implementations of FP (Common Lisp, Scheme, and I especially love
  Haskell). Rather my arguments is that there are better ways of
  designing programs/functions in a way that they <q>do on thing and
  do it well,</q> without designing your programs/functions for use in
  a UNIX shell. It just so happens that Emacs is one of the oldest
  Lisp implementations still in wide-spread use that was originally
  implemented for UNIX OS and it&apos;s clones. Decades of evolution
  have made Emacs one of the most practical means of integrating
  Lisp-style FP within
  the <a href="https://archive.org/details/UNIXProgrammingEnvironment">UNIX
  Programming Environment</a>.</p>

  <p>I also think I should mention that when Emacs
  is <a href="../emacs-for-professionals/emacs-as-your-shell.html">used
  as a shell</a> in place of Bash, you have access to a wider range of
  FP tools. You still have access to all of the shell programs on your
  computer, but you also have access to Lisp functions that compose in
  other ways. You can, for example, capture the output of a command in
  a text buffer, then start applying both Lisp functions and UNIX
  shell programs as filters to the text buffer, seeing the result of
  each transformation as it happens. This allows you to experiment
  with function composition interactively, but without necessarily
  being restricted to the use of the REPL.</p>

  <h3>Emacs is less than perfect, Bash even less so</h3>

  <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/unixprogramminge0000kern">In
  a UNIX Programming Environment</a>, the Bourne shell family of
  languages (like Bash) is the language in which you compose different
  programs into a solution to a problem. It doesn&apos;t have to be
  Bash, any language using
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX API</a> can
  compose shell pipelines. But in practical, day-to-day UNIX or Linux
  system usage, it is usually Bash or some Bourne-family shell
  language.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Bourne shell languages are simply not very
  good programming languages. This is not even a very controversial
  opinion in my experience, so I won&apos;t spend too much time
  explaining why. But I can mention a few of the problems:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><b>String is the only data type.</b> Structured data types must be
    implemented by each respective program, and programs do not always
    implement data structures consistently (e.g. CSV, JSON, or XML),
    or in ways that can share code.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Process forking is CPU and memory intensive.</b> This
    makes the shell interpreter <em>terminally</em> slow.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>No enforcement of calling conventions.</b> Each program
    defines it&apos;s own argument parsing convention, which is why
    most programs take double-hyphen arguments, while some programs
    like <code>find</code> take single-hyphen, and some
    like <code>dd</code> take no hyphens.</p>
    <pre>ls --inode --size --quote-name --color=always;
find . -type d -name .git -prune -false -o -type f -name '*.lisp';
dd if=/dev/urandom of=./white-noise.raw bs=44100 count=5;</pre>

    <li><p><b>No built-in support for atomic operations.</b>
    Asynchronous coroutines are error-prone, race conditions on the
    standard output channel can occur as data from mutliple
    asynchronous programs write to it. Line buffering solves
    this problem <em>most</em> of the time.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>The syntax is crufty and inelegant.</b> This is an
    opinion of aesthetics, but in my experience most people agree with
    this statement. With practice, you can remember all the various
    curly-brace expansions, and understand why the following two lines
    of code do <em>almost</em> the exact same thing:</p>
    <pre>if [[ "${#LIST[@]}" > 10 ]]; then ... ; fi
if [ "${#LIST[@]}" -gt 10 ]; then ... ; fi</pre>

    <p>Still, these syntactic idiosyncrasies really bother some
    people.</p>
  </ul>

  <p>Personally, I do enjoy Bash programming, but I always conscious
  of it&apos;s shortcomings. I would only ever use it to perform
  transformations on a small filesystem, or as a lightweight wrapper
  around an application written in a better programming
  language. Modern Lisp languages have solved all of these problems,
  and scale well to fit applications of any complexity.</p>

  <h3>Conclusions</h3>

  <p>In the <a href="./emacs-unix-04_bourne-shell-is-not-fp.html">part
  3 of this series</a> I talked about how the UNIX Philosophy is
  really a particular description of functional programming. In this
  article (part 4) I talk about how UNIX shell programming is not the
  best way to do functional programming, and suggest that using a Lisp
  programming language such as Emacs is a better way to devise
  software solutions to the various problems you may encounter as you
  use a computer. If you are willing to accept each of those claims as
  truth, then you might also be willing to accept that Emacs also, in
  fact, does fulfill the UNIX Philosophy even better than the UNIX
  shell programming environment. It is just a matter of understanding
  that <q>every program does one thing and does it well</q> not only
  applies to UNIX shell programs, but to Emacs Lisp commands as
  well. And hopefully you can also see that using Emacs gives you
  access to both sets of tools (all of which do one thing well): the
  UNIX CLI tools, and all of the Emacs Lisp tools.</p>

  <p>It seems like perhaps UNIX may have been inspired by Lisp, since
  both UNIX and Lisp have roots in the MIT CSAIL laboratory, both were
  first developed during roughly the same time period (Lisp in the
  late 1950s, UNIX in the late
  1960s). In <a href="./emacs-unix-05_unix-and-lisp-history.html">the
  next section</a> I go into the history of both Lisp and UNIX, and I
  conclude that, no, UNIX took no inspiration from Lisp. However
  innovations in computer technology at the time did influence the
  design of both UNIX and Lisp in similar ways, especially with regard
  to what we now call the Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL).</p>
