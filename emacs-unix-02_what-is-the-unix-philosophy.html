  <p>In <a href="./emacs-unix-01_emacs-is-an-app-platform.html">part 1
  of this series</a> I dispell the myth that Emacs is a <q>bloated</q>
  text editor that does everything. I declare that Emacs is really a
  Lisp interpreer, and therefore it does just one thing and does it
  well: it runs Lisp programs, so in this way, Emacs does fulfill the
  UNIX Philosophy.</p>

  <p>But is this really a satisfactory argument? It might sound like
  Emacs <em>technically</em> follows the UNIX Philosophy, but does not
  really follow the spirit of the philosophy. So in the rest of this
  series, I want to really examine how the UNIX Philosophy is defined,
  what some of the key principles of UNIX are, and whether using Emacs
  allows you to really follow the principles of the UNIX
  Philosophy.</p>

  <h3>What the authorities say</h3>

  <p>Several notable software engineers, most of whom actually worked
  on the UNIX project at Bell Labs, have spoken on the subject:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_McIlroy">Doug
      McIlroy</a> in the foreward to original manual for
      the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bstj57-6-1899/mode/2up">UNIX
      Time-Sharing System</a> in 1978.</p></li>
    <li><p><a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/bwk">Brian
      Kernighan</a>
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob
      Pike&apos;s</a> indispensible text
      book, <a href="https://archive.org/details/unixprogramminge0000kern">The
      UNIX Programming Environment</a> in 1984.</p></li>
    <li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_H._Salus">Peter
      H. Salus</a> who
      wrote <a href="https://archive.org/details/aquartercenturyofunixpeterh.salus_201910">A
      Quarter Century of UNIX</a> in 1994.</p></li>
    <li><p>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond">Eric
      S. Raymond&apos;s</a>
      texbook <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/0131429019/">The
      Art of UNIX Programming</a> in 2003.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Of course, each person has their own way of defining what the
  UNIX Philosophy is. Reading through all of their opinions on what
  the UNIX Philosophy is, I can find three main points that all
  definitions have in common:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p><a href="#def-minimal">Programs should be simple, minimal,
    elegant, general, modular, composable <em>tools</em></a>. Each
    program is a tool that <q>does just one thing, and does it
    well,</q> and tools should be designed to <q>compose</q> to solve
    larger, more specific problems.</p></li>
    <li><p>Programs are composable if they focus on transforming or
    filtering data, and data should usually be both human readable and
    machine readable text whenever possible.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a>
    and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-Expressions</a>
    are good ways to interchange
    data. Nowadays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>
    is likely to be the most popular data interchange format that is
    both human and machine readable.</p></li>
    <li><p>Programs should encourage task automation through
    experimentation. It is implied that using
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">Read-Eval-Print
    Loop (REPL)</a> to experiment with executing programs, and being
    able to immediately see the results of program execution, is an
    important tenet of the UNIX Philosophy.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>So it is clear that the UNIX Philosophy is describing a way of
  thinking about how to design and use <q>programs.</q></p>

  <a name="def-minimal"><h3>Programs are minimalist tools that are composable</h3></a>

  <p>This is usually explained with an adage:</p>

  <blockquote><p><i>Every program does just one thing, and does it
  well.</i></p><p>&mdash; Doug McIlroy</p></blockquote>

  <p>To elaborate on this further:</p>

  <blockquote><p>
    <i>Because the philosophy is based on the relationships between
    programs, we must devote most of the space to discussions about
    the individual tools, but throughout run the themes of combining
    programs and of using programs to build programs. To use the UNIX
    system and its components well, you must understand not only how
    to use the programs, but also how they fit into the
    environment.</i></p>

    <p>&mdash; Kernighan &amp; Pike, preface to <q><i>The UNIX
    Programming Environment</i></q>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The UNIX philosophy is to think of programs as tools. Consider
  what properties of <q>tools</q> in the operating system are
  desirable. Eric S. Raymond describes tools with all of the words
  simple, small, transparent, robust, modular, readable, flexible, and
  composable. Other people use words like minimal, elegant, beautiful,
  and general. The point that the UNIX Philosophers seem to be making
  is that it should be easy to reason about the behavior of a program
  as easily as you can reason about the behavior of a hammer or
  screwdriver. And you should be able to easily reason about ways to
  use programs together in pipelines to transform data.</p>

  <p>I whole-heartedly agree that this is a virtuous property for any
  piece of software to have. After all, humans have evolved a powerful
  innate skill for using tools. So building systems of interconnected
  tools comes naturally to us, and our computational tools should work
  the same. I strongly prefer programs to work like <em>tools</em>, or
  perhaps <em>components</em> similar to electronic circuits &mdash;
  in fact, theoretically any software can be implemented as an digital
  electronic circuit and vice-versa. There is something deeply
  satisfying to me about the idea of software components wired
  together like electrical circuitry, or plumbing in a hydraulic
  system.</p>

  <h3>Conclusions</h3>

  <p>Now we know what the authors of UNIX think, and we have seen
  their authoritative definition of the UNIX philosophy is, as well as
  the opinion of other experts like Eric Raymond and Peter Salus. My
  own definition of the UNIX Philosophy is a reconciliation of all of
  the opinions of these authorities, which is the idea that
  every <q>program</q> is an elegant tool to be used in combination
  with others. UNIX programs should be designed and used as such. In
  the <a href="./emacs-unix-03_unix-is-lesser-fp.html">next article in
  this series</a>, I talk about how UNIX relates to the priniciples of
  functional programming, and Lisp (e.g. Emacs Lisp) in particular. I
  will argue that this notion of a <q>program</q> according to the
  UNIX school of thought, is similar to the notion of
  a <q>function</q> according to the functional programming
  paradigm.</p>
